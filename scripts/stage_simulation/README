move/
- env.world
  Used by Stage to generate the simulation environment. The robot models are included at the top of the file. The bottom of the file
  declares the number of each robot type in the environment. 
  
- madara_init_*.mf
  Initial values for MADARA database for each agent.
  
- move.rviz
  RViz display settings. Automatically generated by RViz. Lines 31-69 are the visualizations for a single robot. 
  
- ros_move.pl
  Launch script for GAMS loops for each agent. 
  
- sim.launch
  Launches map_server, Stage, RViz, and several different utilities for each robot. The namespace for each robot must match a robot
  in env.world.
  
resources/common/
- amcl_diff.launch
  Read by sim.launch. Includes parameters for the AMCL algorithm.
  
- *.yaml
  Read by sim.launch with parameters for various parts of AMCL and path planning/navigation
  
- pioneer.inc
  Robot model file read by sim.launch
  
resources/rooms/
- rooms.bmp
  Read by Stage to generate room in simulator.

- rooms.pgm
  Vacancy map read by the AMCL node.

- rooms_map.yaml
  Setup file for AMCL node.
  

How to customize agents

Add robots in env.world and ensure the correct node groups are also added in sim.launch. The robot_0 and robot_1 groups can be copied, but
make sure the namespace and identical values are changed in each group for the new robot. Give each robot a madara_init_*.mf file. Add 
another GAMS loop for each new robot in ros_move.pl. If only simulating unstructured environments, then the ./resources/rooms files can 
probably be ignored. One problem with that is that localization will need to be updated. It's hard to localize if you can't see anything. 
I have never worked with unstructured environments so I can't help there. If you want visualization in RViz, then copy the lines in
move.rviz for a single robot (see above) and update with the new namespace.

PX4 in Gazebo - https://dev.px4.io/en/simulation/gazebo.html
A year ago this was easy to setup and get a basic UAV travelling around an area, no idea how it is now or how hard it will be to use as
an example for what you need.

Again, this was pretty simple to setup a year ago, but no idea how it is now.
